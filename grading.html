    Below you can see a short feedback for every test that failed,
    indicating the reason for the test failure and how many points
    you lost for each individual test.

    Tests that were aborted took too long too complete or crashed the
    JVM. Such crashes can arise due to infinite non-terminating
    loops or recursion (StackOverflowException) or excessive memory
    consumption (OutOfMemoryException).
